# Multi-Level Anime Person Cropper

This Python script uses pre-trained YOLO models from Hugging Face to automatically detect and crop **anime-style characters** at three levels of detail:
- Full Body (person)
- Half Body (torso)
- Head (face)

It processes entire folders of images and saves the cropped results in a structured output directory.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“¥ Batch processes all `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` images in a folder
- ðŸ§  Uses three YOLO models for:
  - `person` (full body)
  - `halfbody` (upper torso)
  - `head` (face with adjustable scale)
- ðŸ§± Outputs multiple crops per image depending on detections
- ðŸ—‚ Auto-saves output to a new folder next to your input
- ðŸ’¾ CPU-only friendly (no GPU required)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [ultralytics](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/)
- [huggingface_hub](https://pypi.org/project/huggingface-hub/)
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)


## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/citronlegacy/auto-multi-level-person-crop.git
   cd auto-multi-level-person-crop
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```



## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   ```sh
   python multi-level-person-crop.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompt:**  
-   Enter the path to your image folder (supports `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`).  
-   Cropped images will be saved in a new folder with `_output` appended.
+   When prompted, enter the full path to a folder containing your images.
+   (You can drag and drop the folder into the terminal.)
+   Cropped results will be saved in a new folder with `_output` appended to the name.
